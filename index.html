        <h3  > I read a story about Pride and prejudice which is a very interesting novel. I haven't finished it but this is the summary of it
            If you would like to know it in detail then <a href=" Blog two.html"> Click here</a> or on top of picture at blog two. The work, which <em>Austen</em> initially titled First Impressions, is the second of four novels that Austen published during her lifetime. 
            Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for its lack of historical context, the existence of its characters in a social
             bubble that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived.
              She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same time, 
              she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered that 
              the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for its happy dénouement. In the end, Austen’s novel has remained popular
               largely because of Elizabeth—who was reportedly Austen’s own favourite among all her heroines—and because of the enduring appeal
                to men and women alike of a well told and potentially happily ending love story.

        <h3>The idea of this theatre began with the proposal in 1964 to establish a cultural centre. The construction work began in 1995 and was completed three years later. 
            It was built at a cost of RM210 million with a theatre floor area of 21,000 m² as part of the 54,400 m² cultural complexThe building was designed by the local architect fi
            rm, ADC ARCHITECT SDN. The inspiration for the design is based on a traditional moon
             kite in flight. The turquoise folds on the roof and the intricate design of the foyer are just two of the interesting
              features of the building. Istana Budaya's architecture has intrigued experts and academics.
